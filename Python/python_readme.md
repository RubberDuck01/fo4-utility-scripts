# Python stuff
These scripts are primarily used to automate certain processes on a day-to-day basis. I use them whenever the need arises.

## Contents:
### rd_sakr_simplify
Script used to read data from one CSV and export it to the other with some differences. It was heavily used in early stages of my SAKR/RCPGen tool development, but is proven useful for manipulating other CSVs as well.

### RenameBrackets
Small and simple script used to rename files. I used this script to rename a bunch of LM JSONs by adding '(RD)' in front of the names. <i> For better sorting, obviously. </i>

## Requirements
To run these, you need (at least) Python 3.  
I'm personally running Python v3.10, but any v3 should suffice.

#### Hopefully I'll update this README later...
